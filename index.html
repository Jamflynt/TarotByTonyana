			<article id="about">
				<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/aboutMePic2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>My journey started off as a wee lass noticing certain quirks and patterns to people's behaviors and
					anticipating the mood of a room. Eventually, I had a mental rolodex of observations about people in
					my life, family, neighbors, classmates, you name it. I was noticing habits and what was behind their
					eyes most of all. My big sis would have to lug me around when I was five and I would just skip
					around in my jelly shoes while she read aloud to all her cool friends from a scroll she picked up
					from the corner store saying what she was to expect the coming month... that was my introduction to
					ASTROLOGY! I was hooked.
					<br>
					<br>
					Fast forward to the grungey 90's. I spent my teen years casting and writing out by hand basic
					astrology charts. People were so fascinating to me, so different, but yet we all wanted to be
					understood and seen. This was my preferred method of connecting to others. Them entrusting me with
					their exact time and place of birth of the day they were put into this world, me spilling out their
					secrets and private thoughts while the callus on my finger throbbed from my non-stop writing. Alas,
					I was a young adult and knew that I should probably experience coming of age things and not
					laboriously concern myself with chart after chart. And that, my friends, is when I delved into
					TAROT. To me it offered a chance to get down to the nitty gritty of a person's life quicker and by
					combining my Astrology knowledge I made the intuition kick in -- big time.

					<br>
					<br>
					I was in full gear and acquired a Parapsychology diploma (Stratford Career Institute) which included
					studies of other things such as palm and face reading, numerology, angel therapy, and feng shui. I
					know a bit about most metaphysical things... and what I don't know, I will get around to.
					<br>
					<br>
					In 2008 after a cancer diagnosis that made it clear to me that I wasn't living out my purpose, I
					decided to start reading part-time at some shops and did some psychic fairs. I have been reading
					professionally for 16 years.
					<br>
					<br>
					In a reading, self-defeating patterns become blaringly evident to me so I went and got certified in
					HYPNOSIS so that I can also help my clients break those chains that bind. Identifying them is
					important for sure, but liberating oneself... well, that is next level stuff. At this point with my
					3 big loves...TAROT, DREAM INTERPRETATION, and HYPNOSIS, I fancy myself a Subconscious Specialist of
					sorts.
					<br>
					<br>
					How can I be of service to you today?

				<span class="image main"><img src="images/kindWords.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>
					"I have known Tonyana for a few years after I met her at an event. I've since hosted her in my home
					on a few occasions for parties. My friends who have come to have their readings definitely enjoy
					her, as well as the social time we get while each person has their turn for her reading. The last
					time she came, my husband had a reading done as well. The most amazing part of this reading is that
					Tonyana lets you record your session. One afternoon about 3 months after our readings, we sat
					together and listen to both of our recordings. We both couldn't believe in hindsight how accurate
					she had been and her insight on our situation at the time and saw her guidance turned out to be spot
					on. This girl definitely has a sixth sense about people. Not only that, she is incredibly genuine and kind and brings a positivity with her that I greatly appreciate and admire. I highly recommend
					Tonyana for her Tarot readings." <br>

				<p>"Tonyana's readings are spot on. She brings such a tranquil energy and is an absolute pleasure to know.
					I highly recommend her readings to gain clarity for yourself. She is a blessing."<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Kellie from Fairfield, OH</em><br>
					<em>Learning and Development Consultant</em>
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
					"I have been working with Tonyana through her Tarot for years now and just recently benefited from hypnosis sessions with her too. Honestly, her presence has really changed my thinking and I feel so much better these days! Negative worry type thoughts don't fester around in my mindset anymore like they used to. I'm way more positive and am doing new approaches that I would have never attempted before. She has really made a huge impact on my life. I remember our interactions exactly when I need them and know what to do. She has helped me remember and reclaim MY POWER!"
