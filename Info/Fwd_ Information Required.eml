ABOUT ME:
   My journey started off as a wee lass noticing certain quirks and
patterns to people's behaviors and anticipating the mood of a room.
Eventually, I had a mental rolodex of observations about people in my life,
family, neighbors, classmates, you name it, I was noticing habits and what
was behind their eyes most of all.  My big sis would have to lug me around
when I was 5 and I would just skip around in my jelly shoes while she read
aloud to all her cool friends from a scroll she picked up from the corner
store what she was to expect the coming month...that was my introduction to
ASTROLOGY!  I was hooked.
  Fast forward to the grungey 90's I spent my teen years casting and
writing out by hand basic astrology charts.  People were so fascinating to
me, so different, but yet we all wanted to be understood and seen. This was
my preferred method of connecting to others.  Them entrusting me with their
exact time and place of birth of the day they were put into this world, me
spilling out their secrets and private thoughts while the callus on my
finger throbbed from my non-stop writing.  Alas...I was a young adult and
knew that I should probably experience coming of age things and not
laboriously concern myself with chart after chart.  And that, my friends,
is when I delved into TAROT.  To me it offered a chance for me to get down
to the nitty gritty of people's life quicker and by combining my Astrology
knowledge I made the intuition kick in ...big time.
   I was in full gear and acquired a Parapsycology diploma (Stratford
Career Institute) which included studies of other things such as palm and
face reading, numerology, angel therapy and fengshui.   I know a bit about
most metaphysical things....and what I don't know I will get around to.
   In 2008 after a cancer diagnosis that made it clear to me that I wasn't
living out my purpose. I decided to start reading part-time at some shops
and did some psychic fairs.  I have been reading professionally for 14
years.
  In a reading, self-defeating patterns become blaringly evident to me so I
went and got certified in HYPNOSIS so I can also help my clients break
those chains that bind.  Identifying them is important for sure, but
liberating oneself...well, that is next level stuff.
  At this point with my 3 big loves...TAROT, DREAM INTERPRETATION, and
HYPNOSIS I fancy myself a Subconscious Specialist of sorts.

How can I be of service?

Hi! Jamie wrote down the things he needs to do your site. He will do a
pretty simple site, so it won't take long and won't be overly complicated.
There will be 4 separate pages: the general Home page, About Me with more
detail than the home page blurb, Services with Prices, and a Contact page.
He could also add a blog section if you wanted an area to write news
updates and other thoughts, or enlightenments and information, etc.
Basically, it is up to you whether you want a static info page to direct
people to, or an engaging blog type site. Both are easy to set up, but one
is more work for you.

Okay, this is what he wrote down:

"1. a url is a monthly or yearly expense. [he (or melissa) can set you up
with all of that, but its the difference between www dot tarotbytonyana dot
com and tarotbytonyana dot wordpress dot com, so highly recommended]

2. An "about me" blurb -- just a few paragraphs telling her story [if you
hate the idea of doing this, i can make one for your approval]

3. Price List and Services
 -- description of what each service is
 -- any additional information you'd want to be included

4. Any and all photos you would want featured, of yourself or your cards [I
will draw anything decorative if needed, and include the art nouveau
portrait of you if you'd like]

5. Her "elevator pitch" -- a short paragraph about her bizness and who she
is --> this is for the homepage and will be seen first

6. Logo with 4 variations [I will make you some logos to approve]

7. Address, location, phone number, email -- whatever contact information
you are comfortable providing. [he can also make a form where they can just
fill it out on there and email you]"

Oh he also recommends setting up a google business page if you don't
already have one.

All right! This is a good step. Fill out what you can, ask anything you
need to ask, and there's no rush on it.

Have a great day!!
