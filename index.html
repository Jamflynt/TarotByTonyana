				<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/aboutImage.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>My journey started off as a wee lass noticing certain quirks and patterns to people's behaviors and
					anticipating the mood of a room. Eventually, I had a mental rolodex of observations about people in
					my life, family, neighbors, classmates, you name it, I was noticing habits and what was behind their
					eyes most of all. My big sis would have to lug me around when I was 5 and I would just skip around
					in my jelly shoes while she read aloud to all her cool friends from a scroll she picked up from the
					corner store what she was to expect the coming month...that was my introduction to ASTROLOGY! I was
					hooked.
					<br>
					<br>
					Fast forward to the grungey 90's I spent my teen years casting and writing out by hand basic
					astrology charts. People were so fascinating to me, so different, but yet we all wanted to be
					understood and seen. This was my preferred method of connecting to others. Them entrusting me with
					their exact time and place of birth of the day they were put into this world, me spilling out their
					secrets and private thoughts while the callus on my finger throbbed from my non-stop writing.
					Alas...I was a young adult and knew that I should probably experience coming of age things and not
					laboriously concern myself with chart after chart. And that, my friends, is when I delved into
					TAROT. To me it offered a chance for me to get down to the nitty gritty of people's life quicker and
					by combining my Astrology knowledge I made the intuition kick in ...big time.
					<br>
					<br>
					I was in full gear and acquired a Parapsycology diploma (Stratford Career Institute) which included
					studies of other things such as palm and face reading, numerology, angel therapy and fengshui. I
					know a bit about most metaphysical things....and what I don't know I will get around to.
					<br>
					<br>
					In 2008 after a cancer diagnosis that made it clear to me that I wasn't living out my purpose. I
					decided to start reading part-time at some shops and did some psychic fairs. I have been reading
					professionally for 14 years.
					<br>
					<br>
					In a reading, self-defeating patterns become blaringly evident to me so I went and got certified in
					HYPNOSIS so I can also help my clients break those chains that bind. Identifying them is important
					for sure, but liberating oneself...well, that is next level stuff.
					At this point with my 3 big loves...TAROT, DREAM INTERPRETATION, and HYPNOSIS I fancy myself a
					Subconscious Specialist of sorts.
					<br>
					<br>
					How can I be of service to you today?
